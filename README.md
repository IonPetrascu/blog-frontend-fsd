This is the frontend part of a blogging platform built with Vue.js, TypeScript, and following the Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) methodology. The application leverages WebSocket for real-time communication and includes the following features:

- **Posts**: Create, delete, and manage blog posts.
- **Comments**: Users can comment on posts and manage their comments.
- **Profile Management**: Each user has a profile with information about their activity.
- **Likes**: Users can like both posts and comments.
- **Subscriptions**: Follow authors (to receive updates on their posts - in development)
- **Followers**: Users can view their subscribers and who they are following.
- **Chat**: Real-time chat functionality that allows users to communicate with each other, enhancing community interaction.

This project aims to provide a seamless user experience for interacting with blog content and maintaining an active community.
